Project proposal

The motivations and background:
This project is trying to immitate the natural human flow under certain scenarios. It is very important for making a realistic game, and this would be very valuable for testing the design of buildings. For example, test a cinema if it can be evacuated in a certain period of time.

State-of-art and new challenges
In 2006, AirBus company hired more than 800 people to do an evacuation test on AirBus A380 aircraft. It is a standard test for not just AirBus but also Boeing and other companies.
There is a software called "Pathfinder" which focuses in evacuation simulation, which works pretty well according to the video on its website.

Proposed tasks
Let people pass turning corners without any reflux or stagnation;
Avoid weird looking stuff;
Try to make it as realistic as possible.

Some possible ideas or alternatives that you plan to pursue or evaluate
Calculate the gravity between humans to influence the movement;
Use a repulsive force to push people away from being too close;
Use physics-based heuristic functions for guiding through turnings and other special scenarios.

Minimum expected contribution or accomplishment(s)
Implement the algorithm and present the result in a unity-based application (no matter how it really performs).
